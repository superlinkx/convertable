# convertable

A simple open-source conversions app

## Why?!

Because I wanted to learn Flutter and this was a silly app idea I was given

## What's next?

Goal is to include a number of common conversion calculations. The current code
is super naive, so it'll need some work before additional calculations can be added.

I'd also like to eventually get fancier with the UX/UI aspects of the app as I have
interest/time
